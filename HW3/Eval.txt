Task 3:

My output did not match the expected output of evaluate. I got:

While output gets some of the words correct, it incorrectly parses on words that begin with vowel. Sometimes it a coda will be 
incorrectly added to a nucleus. Sometimes a nucleus does not have onset or coda, and my machine does not consistently isolate that. 
I wish there was a cleaner way to obtain the results I got - I ended up reversing syllables, and my solution was a bit roundabout. 

I think the challenging part is determining the coda and onset length correctly. Many things were parsed similarly, but not quite there. 
For example: BER + LIGHNG + TAHN was parsed in my code as BERL + IHNG + TAHN, because the coda has too many consonants. This might be because
Onset Maximization might be applied here on accident.
